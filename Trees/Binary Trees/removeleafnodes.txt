// Given a binary tree, remove all leaf nodes from it. Leaf nodes are those nodes, which don't have any children.
Note:
1. Root will also be a leaf node if it doesn't have left and right child. 
2. You don't need to print the tree, just remove all leaf nodes and return the updated root.



BinaryTreeNode<int>* removeLeafNodes(BinaryTreeNode<int> *root) {
   
    
    if(root==NULL)
    {
        return root;
    }
    
    else
    {
    
    if(root->left==NULL && root->right==NULL)
    {
        return NULL;
    }
    
    root->left=removeLeafNodes(root->left);
    
    root->right=removeLeafNodes(root->right);
